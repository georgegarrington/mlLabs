We have shown that a dataset needs to be properly inspected and some data cleaning techniques performed before applying any Machine Learning algorithm. Significant improvement can be obtained by not only changing the Machine Learning algorithm but combining it with feature engineering. There are a number of things that we have not covered here, but you can learn them by trying our exercises below."

    "- Create a vector of 1000 or more numerical values. (These can be the same value or different values.) We will treat this vector's as true target values that our Machine Learning model needs to predict as accurate as possible.\n",
    "- Generate a vector of the same size where this new vector's values has a normal (Gaussian) distribution with zero mean and a unit variance. (You can use numpy.random.normal().) Visualise the distribution of these values with a histogram. We will treat them as errors that our Machine Learning model make.\n",
    "- Duplicate the true target values and apply this Guassian errors to them simply by pairwise summing.\n",
    "- Compute RMSE and MAE from the noisy prediction and the true target values.\n",
